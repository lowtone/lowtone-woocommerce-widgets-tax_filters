# WooCommerce Taxonomy Filters

_DEPRECATED: This plugin was replaced by [Term Filters plugin](https://github.com/lowtone/lowtone-terms-filter) which adds support for post types other than products._

This plugin provies a widget similar to the [WooCommerce Layered Nav](http://docs.woothemes.com/document/woocommerce-widgets/) widget but adds support for non-attribute product taxonomies.
